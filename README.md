This is a toy compiler made to practice compiler design in flex and bison.

Directory structure :-
    Makefile - used to cmpile the compiler
    Notes_About_Flex - used to keep notes while learning since there is not much information about flex and bison online
    Binaries - contains the built compiler binary
    Compiler_Output - containsthe out files generated when testing input programs
    Includes - contains header files with declarations of structures and functions
    Output_Flex_Bison - contains the fiels that are generated by flex and bison
    Source - contains the descriptions of the Includes and code for flex bison input files;
        also contains the program dot file and program pdf and a makefile used randomly for testing
    Test_Programs - contains the programs used to test the compiler

Files :-
    program.dot - contains dot code which explains the flow of various structures and code throught various files during compilation
    program.pdf - contains the pdf showing the flow of various funcitons and structures from one file to another

TODO :-
    implement the symbol table for the toy language
