This is a toy compiler made to practice compiler design in flex and bison.

## Directory structure
    **Makefile** - used to cmpile the compiler
    **Notes_About_Flex** - used to keep notes while learning since there is not much information
        about flex and bison online
    **Binaries** - contains the built compiler binary
    **Compiler_Output** - containsthe out files generated when testing input programs
    **Includes** - contains header files with declarations of structures and functions
    **Output_Flex_Bison** - contains the fiels that are generated by flex and bison
    **Source** - contains the descriptions of the Includes and code for flex bison input files;
        also contains the program dot file and program pdf and a makefile used randomly for testing
    **Test_Programs** - contains the programs used to test the compiler

## Files
    **program.dot** - contains dot code which explains the flow of various structures and code
        through various files during compilation
    **program.pdf** - contains the pdf showing the flow of various funcitons and structures from one
        file to another

## Building Compiler
1. `Install make`
2. `Install flex`
3. `Install bison`
4. `Install graphviz CLI tools`
4. `Run make from New_Language_Compiler folder`
5. `Run compiler binary with correct input`

## Usage Directions
```
./compiler Input_File_Path Output_File_Path
```

TODO :-
    Implement the Three Address Code generation for the toy language.
